## Hi folks! My name is OctÃ¡vio Oliveira! Brazilian 43 years old.

Tourismologist with a restless profile searching constantly for knowledge and challenges.

I worked for about <b>20 years in the corporate travel market</b>, with most of my time dedicated to travel agencies. I also worked providing online travel technology (Online Booking Tool) for this market, with a greater focus on lectures, training and commercial support to the customer.

Currently I have been dedicated to the Big Data/Data Science area, seeking to absorb knowledge through technical courses, which motivated me to pursue a new degree, this time in the exact sciences area. The degree is called <b>Big Data and Analytical Intelligence.</b>

Why this area? In addition to being an evolving sector (both the market and in technological solutions), I am absolutely fascinated by the art of finding (and generating) valuable information between the lines of data.

"Data is the new oil!" - Humby, Clive

Allow me to agree disagreeing with the above statement. Although I undoubtedly agree with the comparison in terms of added value and the power it offers in extracting "by-products", I understand that oil is finite.
